## Welcome to your Weather App! üå§Ô∏è

This is my first weather forecasting app created with Expo in just 4 hours. It allows users to view the weather forecast of a city by fetching data from a weather API. It uses api of weatherapi.com

## Features

- **Weather Forecasting**: Get detailed weather information including temperature, conditions, and location details.

- **Interactive Charts**: Visual representation of temperature trends over a selected forecast period.

- **City Search**: Enter any city to fetch the latest weather data.
